to do:

//collision
  enemys collide with player
    reduce hp (remove enemy?)
    
  //shots collide with enemys
    //reduce enemy hp
    //if hp <= 0 destroy enemy (pop from array)


//start player in the middle or bottom of the screen

//spawn enemies on the outskirts
  //spawn one every 5 seconds or so for now
    // figure out why the spawning isn't working (spawn positions are there)
  //add to the array when spawned, 
  pop when killed

//move enemies towards the player
  //create velocity towards the players location (random velocity for now)

//create projectile object

//enable player projectiles
  //on click:
    //get mouse position
    //spawn projectile
    //move projectile towards the position (velocity tbd)
    
    
remove unneeded rotated player textures from Player class constructor


main idea:

simple html 5 exercise

projectile based defense

player is immobile
aim and shoot with mouse, show firing angle
shoot slow moving projectiles at moving targets
some enemies can shoot, player can shoot enemy shots, or parry with perfect timing when hit.
